* while setting up sso.local .env/db/postgresql.log ends up with:

FATAL:  role "postgres" does not exist

=> This may be "expected" according to mfoord


* bzr+ssh://bazaar.launchpad.net/~canonical-isd-hackers/isd-configs/sso-config/ is missing in the sso config and local.cfg should also be generated to refer to that.
